# beer_type_categorization

Data classification organizes data into categories for efficient and creative use. In this project, we will look at 74k beer recipes and classify them by beer type. 

## The Data
These features will be explored to classify the data:

*OGSpecific gravity of wort before fermentation

*FGSpecific gravity of wort after fermentation

*ABVAlcohol By Volume

*IBUInternational Bittering Units

*ColorStandard Reference Method - light to dark ex. 40 = black

*BoilSizeFluid at beginning of boil

*BoilTimeTime wort is boiled

*BoilGravitySpecific gravity of wort before the boil

*EfficiencyBeer mash extraction efficiency - extracting sugars from the grain during mash

*MashThicknessAmount of water per pound of grain

*SugarScaleScale to determine the concentration of dissolved solids in wort

*BrewMethodVarious techniques for brewing

*PitchRateYeast added to the fermentor per gravity unit - M cells/ml/deg P

*PrimaryTempTemperature at the fermenting stage

*PrimingMethodN

*PrimingAmountAmount of priming sugar used

## Exploratory Data Analysis 
(Clean data and visualize data. Note interesting features in the data. Reduce number of types and explain process for reduction)
